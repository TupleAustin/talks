# Contributing

To create a new talk, copy the `_template` folder to a new
talk folder, `your-talk-name`. Edit the `slides.md` file and
`README.md` file with your talk details and commit any demo
code that may be helpful. Use [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/)
to generate a PDF version of the slides.

When complete, add an entry in the `README.md` document.
