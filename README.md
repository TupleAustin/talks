# Tuple Talks

Training sessions [Tuple](http://wearetuple.co/).

## Culture

One of the best ways to strengthen your knowledge about something is to teach it to others. Here at Tuple, we encourage growth through cross-team collaboration by encouraging every member of the Tuple team to participate in a weekly training session held by one (or many) Tuple folks.

## Format

Every Friday, a member of our team presents a training session on something that is cool and exciting to them. It can range from software development to design methodology to solutions architecture to artificial intelligence. As long as it is something that can be spoken about with high levels of knowledge and passion, it is welcomed and encouraged.

### Standard

A standard talk is very flexible. It is really up to the discretion of the presented to craft a format that makes sense for the topic they are talking about. It can be 30 minutes of slide based lecture followed by 30 minutes of Q/A, an hour long walkthrough of some new tech, or a 15 minute intro and a 45 minute hackathon.

### Lightning

Lightning talks take place on the first Friday of every month and should be only 10-15 minutes a piece. This gives multiple people the opportunity to showcase what they're working on, or demo some new project that they have been playing with.

## Process

### Submitting an Idea

To submit an idea for a topic, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/issues/new). In this repository, topics for presentations are represented as GitHub Issues, and are used to track and guide their progress.

### Claiming a Topic

Most of the time, people will claim the topics that they submit. However, if you're just **itching** to do a presentation, use the [Presentation Topics](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/projects/1) Project in GitHub to see a list of topic ideas that are available. Find one that interests you, and (politely) ask the person who originally submitted it if you can claim it.

### Researching a Topic

Now that you've claimed a topic, it's on you to come up with the content and the format for the presentation. You are encouraged to discuss your ideas for the topic in the GitHub issue. Useful stuff to write down and get help with would be a general outline for the presentation as a whole, as well as gauging the rest of the team's interest in how deep they'd like to dive into the topic.

### Scheduling your Presentation

We track the schedule of the presentations using [Milestones](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) in GitHub. Each milestone represents a Friday training session, and the issues associated with those milestones represent the presentations that will be / were given that day.

## Contributing

Use the "Watch" feature in GitHub to be notified when activity happens in this repository so that you can help your fellow Tuple folks with their presentations. The goal is for everyone to gain some value from these, so let's help each other help each other!
