# Tuple Talks

Training sessions by [Tuple](http://wearetuple.co/). Check out the [website](https://tupleaustin.github.io/talks/)!

## Culture

One of the best ways to strengthen your knowledge about something is to teach it to others. Here at Tuple, we encourage growth through cross-team collaboration by encouraging everyone at Tuple to participate in a weekly training session held by one (or many) Tuple folks.

## Format

Every Friday, a member of our team presents a training session on something that is cool and exciting to them. It can range from software development to design methodology to solutions architecture to artificial intelligence. As long as it is something that can be spoken about with high levels of knowledge and passion, it is welcomed and encouraged.

### Standard

A standard talk is very flexible. It is really up to the discretion of the presented to craft a format that makes sense for the topic they are talking about. It can be 30 minutes of slide based lecture followed by 30 minutes of Q/A, an hour long walkthrough of some new tech, or a 15 minute intro and a 45 minute hack-a-thon.

### Lightning

Lightning talks take place on the first Friday of every month and should be 10-15 minutes a piece.

## Process

We use GitHub for managing the schedule and backlog of presentations.

### Submitting an Idea

To submit an idea for a topic, create a new note in the "Idea" column in the [Presentation Topics](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/projects/1) project in this repository.

1. Be on the [Presentation Topics](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/projects/1) project page
2. Click the "+" button in the "Ideas" column
3. Write your topic idea
4. Click "Add Note"

### Claiming a Topic

Most of the time, you will claim a topic immediately after you submit the idea. However, if you see a topic idea that hasn't been claimed that looks interesting, feel free to claim it (after politely asking the person who created the idea if they intentionally didn't claim it themselves).

1. Be on the [Presentation Topics](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/projects/1) project page
2. Click the dropdown icon in the Idea that you wish to claim
3. Click "Convert to Issue"
4. Add some additional notes about the topic
5. Click "Convert to Issue"
6. Move the newly created issue to the "Claimed" column
7. Click the issue
8. Click "assign yourself" under the "Assignees" section on the right side

### Researching a Topic

Now that you've claimed a topic, it's on you to come up with the content and the format for the presentation. You are encouraged to discuss your ideas for the topic in the GitHub issue. Useful stuff to write down and get help with would be a general outline for the presentation as a whole, as well as gauging the rest of the team's interest in how deep they'd like to dive into the topic.

### Scheduling your Presentation

We track the schedule of the presentations using [Milestones](https://github.com/TupleAustin/talks/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) in GitHub. Each milestone represents a Friday training session, and the issues associated with those milestones represent the presentations that will be / were given that day.

1. Be on the topic's Issue page
2. Click the gear icon next to the "Milestones" section on the right side
3. Choose the day that you'd like to give your presentation
